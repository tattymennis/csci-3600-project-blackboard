# csci-3600-project-blackboard
This repository contains the implementation of a simple ASP.NET MVC website modelling an asynchronous, encrypted virtual blackboard for CSCI 3600 Internet Programming at Augusta University.
=======
This project was assigned by Dr. Paul York and was my first attempt at completing a novel work in the domain of internet programming and cryptography.  I began with limited knowledge in ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, JSON, AJAX, and a broad but shallow understanding of cryptographic techniques.
